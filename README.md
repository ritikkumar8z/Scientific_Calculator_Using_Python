# Scientific Calculator
 
### A simple, command-line-based scientific calculator built with Python. This calculator performs basic arithmetic operations as well as scientific functions like trigonometric calculations, logarithmic functions, and exponentiation. 

## Features   
 
- **Basic Arithmetic**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.
- **Scientific Functions**:  
  - Power and square root
  - Logarithm (with customizable base)
  - Trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, tangent)

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### Running the Calculator

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt in the project directory.
3. Run the calculator with:

   ```bash
